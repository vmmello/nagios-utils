This plugin does an HTTP request and measures the times of the response
(nslookup time, connect time, header time, first byte time, total time)
and compares it with the specified maximum values.

It reports the status as CRITICAL when the response times are higher than
the values specified. Otherwise it returns OK.

It also outputs the performance metrics in the format expected by nagios
for performance data.
