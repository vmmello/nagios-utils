This plugin gets all authoritative DNS servers of a domain and tests
whether all of it reply with the same serial in the SOA record.

The list of DNS servers is fetched from the NS record list of the domain. It
uses the local resolver to do the DNS queries (there's no need to pass the
list of DNS servers to test).


REQUIREMENTS

bash >= 3.0
dig
