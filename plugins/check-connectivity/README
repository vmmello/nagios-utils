This script verifies the network connectivity by checking the reachability
of multiple web sites. It implicitly checks for multiple aspects of the 
connectivity, like:

  * ability to resolve hostnames in DNS
  * ability to complete a TCP connection in a reasonable time
  * ability to do a full HTTP data transfer in a reasonable time
  
It uses curl to test the network connectivity, so any protocol supported by
curl can be used to determine network reachability.


One of the most relevant use cases is to set it as the check-host command 
of routers, so that it detects connectivity downtime quickly and avoids 
floods of downtime notifications for other checks that require 
Internet connectivity. It's also possible to cache the response in order to
avoid unnecessary checks in a short interval (when the host is set as parent
host related to multiple other checks).

IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity should be tested separately in order to test
routing reachability of each protocol.

It uses the curl program to do the connection tests and measure response 
times.
