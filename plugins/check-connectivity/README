This script verifies the network connectivity by checking the reachability
of multiple web sites. It implicitly checks for multiple aspects of the 
connectivity, like:

  * ability to resolve hostnames in DNS
  * ability to complete a TCP connection in a reasonable time
  * ability to do a full HTTP data transfer in a reasonable time
  
It uses curl to test the network connectivity, so any protocol supported by
curl can be used to determine network reachability.


One of the most relevant use cases is to set it as the check-host command 
of routers that are set as parent of external hosts, so that it detects 
connectivity downtime quickly and avoids floods of downtime notifications 
for other checks that require Internet connectivity. By default it also
caches the response in order to avoid unnecessary checks in a short interval.

IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity should be tested separately in order to test
routing reachability of each protocol.

It uses the curl program to do the connection tests.


REQUIREMENTS

bash >= 3.x
curl


SETUP

The caching functionality uses by default the directory
/var/cache/check-connectivity. To use this directory it's needed to create
it and set the proper permissions to the nagios user. It's possible to do it
with the following commands:

# mkdir /var/cache/check-connectivity
# chown nagios:nagios /var/cache/check-connectivity
